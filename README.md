#IdiotAI API Version 0.1

##IdiotAI API is in Public Early Release. You may not get 100% perfect results while using our API. Responses are still being made.

IdiotAI API is a ChatBot API service that can respond to your questions with idiotic responses. No additional packages required (except the request packages. See the Packages section)

The IdiotAI API is designed mainly for Discord, Guilded bots, and Revolt bots but you can add our API to your programs.

Documentation: https://idiotcreaturehater.gitbook.io/idiotaiapi

Http requests has been tested and confirmed to work on Python 3.8.x to Python 3.10.x and Javascript v14.7.1 to Javascript v16. Our API may work on older or newer versions of Python or Javascript but has no guarantee. This would really depend on if the version of Python or Javascript supports http requests.

###Packages
A package is required to use our API. Here are the console commands to install the required packages.
For Python:   python -m pip install requests
For Javascript:   npm install axios

###Examples
I have provided examples for Python and Javascript so you can setup your program to have our API easily. Examples are in the examples folder.
We can not help you setting up the API for other languages. Ask the support of your preferred coding language on how to make http requests

###Contribute
We do not recommend self-hosting our API. The API files is here because we want everyone to help make our IdiotAI ChatBot API better.
If you want to help making our ChatBot API better or you have an example in your coding language that you think would go inside the examples folder, open a pull request or a new issue.

###Special Thanks
We want to thank these people who helped private tested my API before the Public Early Release.
